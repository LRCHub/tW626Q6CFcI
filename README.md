[00:07.86] There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:12.42] Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
[00:16.81] Finally, I can see you crystal clear
[00:21.35] Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship bare
[00:47.85] 
[00:26.24] See how I'll leave with every piece of you
[00:30.58] Don't underestimate the things that I will do
[00:34.75] There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:39.69] Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
[01:08.19] 
[00:45.22] The scars of your love remind me of us
[00:49.88] They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
[00:54.23] The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
[00:59.08] I can't help feeling
[01:09.08] 
[01:01.35] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[01:06.13] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[01:10.37] You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[01:15.17] And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[01:51.67] 
[01:21.05] Baby, I have no story to be told
[01:25.46] But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
[01:30.26] Think of me in the depths of your despair
[01:34.45] Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
[01:59.95] 
[01:38.96] (You're gonna wish you never had met me) the scars of your love remind me of us
[01:44.72] (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
[01:49.49] (You're gonna wish you never had met me) the scars of your love, they leave me breathless
[01:54.03] (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling
[02:26.03] 
[01:56.05] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:01.14] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[02:05.28] You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:10.53] And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[02:47.03] 
[02:14.43] Could've had it all
[02:19.34] Rolling in the deep
[02:23.40] You had my heart inside of your hand
[02:28.18] But you played it with a beating
[02:44.18] 
[02:34.07] Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
[02:38.23] Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
[02:43.03] Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
[02:47.22] You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
[03:15.72] 
[02:53.31] (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:55.49] We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:00.21] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:05.03] It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:38.03] 
[03:09.27] We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:14.05] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:18.92] You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:23.82] And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[04:00.32] 
[03:27.78] Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:32.69] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:36.80] You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:41.73] But you played it, you played it, you played it
[03:45.66] You played it to the beat
